This template launches official FreeBSD AMI from AWS Market Place, currently 12.2. 
It uses IaC trought Terraform to provide a high secure and accurate way to 
start your EC2 instances, accordingly to:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adiel-Ribeiro/Terraform/master/terraform-ec2-description

Besides these initial steps, this template go above and beyond, it also configures
your FreeBSD EC2 instance in a high secure way, automatically. 

*****  Please, modify this file accordingly to your needs! ************************************* 

Some aspects that were configured: 

* SSH authentication: with public key and password, wich can be used as a fallback logon 
concerning to key authentication errors. 
Default port changed. 
Timeout for inactive connections. 
Protection against Brute Force attacks. 
Limit for origin connections. 
Another fallback that will work in case of failure of the primary key assignment 
to the instance.  
Auditing of logons. 
No root login and so on.

* Custom Kernel: I've compiled a Hardened Kernel wich removed all unnecessary drivers 
and services and is optimized for AWS, it also has Security enhancements. 

* OS Hardening: Prohibited users from see each other proccess, root proccess, removed unnecessary 
proccess, disabled unnecessary services, closed unnecessary listening ports and much more, accordingly
to Information Security best practises. 

You should reffer to the related files in this repository if you desire to understand all changes 
that were made on the system trought Terraform. 

Please, login to your instance once, your password is your ipv4 address, this is 
also your root (su) password. 
Remember to change these passwords and reboot your instance before use. 

Some other things that you should do to add additional layers of security to 
your instance: 

Create a partitioning schema; 
Enable FreeBSD Secure Level; 

I will automate this above as soon as possible, in another terraform template. 

I look forward you enjoy my work, comments, doubts and more, please contact me!
